Hi!

I made this game mostly while I was at high school.

I spent a lot of time on it.

It started out as a very simple game where you fought some baddies on a randomly generated map (just rocks lying around), then I added 3 simple scenarios (one, your weapon won't start working for a while, and there are fewer enemies, another, their weapons won't start working for a while, but there are more enemies). The other was no special properties, and a medium number of enemies - probably 3.

From there it grew - more enemies, a sequence of hand made levels, then I wanted level triggers. I wish I still had the first version to show you...

The earliest modifed file in here is a Takedown icon from 2001-03-30. That's the earliest date I know I was working on Takedown. The icon could have been quite early because the graphics of Takedown were used even in the very first primative version. (They were made in Bryce.)

The file AAAOld.tdm, modified 2002-01-04, has an older version of the campaign, when it had first-person writing inspired by Max Payne. Coolies. I'm glad I kept it. It probably isn't runnable any more without modifications, though.

The earliest source backup is from 2002-07-07.

From the file modified dates, it appears that I worked on Takedown soldidly at least until 2003-11-12, and perhaps longer 

- module.bas was last modifed on 2004-04-22. 
- the logfile +takedown.txt, the options form, and the level data was last modifed on 2005-03-13.

========================================
edit 2008-10-31: 

How long did development last for?

Latest changes: the main game file frm_game.frm was modified 2005-06-21. That was when I was at uni, and may have been a small one-off change.

The last 'release' I made was the update patch, created on 2005-03-31 (date of the readme file). This could be considered the end of TakeDown. But the release probably came after my work slowed right down.

I know that I was working hard and solidly when I created the new enemy teamwork sound effects - on 2003-12-27. So the real development time was at least until then.

The previous release was 'Takedown10' (TakeDown 1.0) created on 2003-07-05.


Main development time:
Takedown 1.0:	2001-03-30 to 2003-07-05	2 years, 3 months
hard work period?	2001-03-30 to 2003-12-27	2 years, 9 months (at least)
To last release	2001-03-30 to 2005-03-13	4 years (3 years, 11.5 months)
